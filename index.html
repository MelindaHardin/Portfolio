    <p>
      Melinda was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky where she and her four siblings (one being her twin sister) developed
      and appreciated the hospitable customs of the South. After graduating from Jeffersontown High School, Melinda relocated
      to Bowling Green, Kentucky to attend the University of the Hilltoppers, Western Kentucky University. While at Western,
      she studied journalism. She then transferred to Sullivan University in her home city of Louisville, where she obtained
      an Associate’s of Science degree in Paralegal Studies in 2006. Melinda later returned to Western Kentucky University
      where she completed and obtained a Bachelor’s of Science in Organizational Leadership.

      Although Melinda values the traditions of the South and Midwest, she also appreciates the diversity that comes with living
      in a larger city. While living in Miami, Florida, Melinda was a promotional model, paralegal, and owned and operated
      a home staging business,
      <em>Existing Compliments</em>. These opportunities encouraged Melinda to peruse other passions outside of modeling and
      a paralegal career. As
      <em>Existing Compliments</em> expanded its services and materials, Melinda took it upon herself to update the company website
      to reflect the changes. Successfully teaching herself the very basics HTML and CCS.

      In 2014, Melinda married her Louisville native boyfriend of 8 years, Joey Hardin, in the Smokey Mountains of Gatlinburg Tennessee.
      Melinda and Joey have since relocated to Dallas, Texas and then to the Kansas City Metro area, where they have lived
      since April of 2016. Melinda and Joey enjoy traveling, socializing and hiking in the beautiful Kansas City area parks.
      Melinda still practices her interrior design passions with the
      <em>Airbnb</em> they currently opperate in their home. She is also learning to put her design passions to use as a website
      developer.
